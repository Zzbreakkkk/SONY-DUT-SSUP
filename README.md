## 1.Arm Control

We use the SONY Spresense board to transmit positional coordinate signals to a robotic arm. The robotic arm can then adjust its orientation based on these signals to accurately identify and grasp objects. This setup ensures precise object location recognition and efficient handling.

## 2.Avoidance Control

We utilize the SONY Spresense board connected to an external ToF (Time-of-Flight) depth camera to acquire real-time depth information. This setup enables obstacle avoidance functionality, with the SONY Spresense board playing a crucial role in processing and transmitting the depth data to ensure smooth and efficient navigation.

## 3.Path Control

Using the SONY Spresense board with its companion camera, we have developed a color tracking model trained on SONY's NNC (Neural Network Console) platform. The SONY Spresense board then controls a mobile vehicle, enabling precise path control and navigation based on the color tracking algorithm.

## 4.Positioning Control

Using the SONY Spresense board paired with a ToF (Time-of-Flight) camera, we have achieved precise position control for a mobile vehicle. This system ensures the vehicle can accurately stop at designated locations by utilizing real-time depth information processed by the SONY Spresense board.

## 5.Target Tracking

Using the SONY Spresense board and a tracking algorithm trained on SONY's NNC (Neural Network Console) platform, we have enabled a following vehicle to track a leading vehicle in real-time. Both vehicles are controlled by SONY Spresense boards, ensuring precise and coordinated movement.
